Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) Linux Driver
===========================

Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) Linux Driver allows applications to access
the Intel(R) Active Management Technology (Intel(R) AMT) FW via host
interface (as opposed to a network interface).

The Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) Linux Driver is meant to be used by the
Local Manageability Service. When the Intel AMT machine is in Legacy Mode,
the Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) Linux driver functions as the KCS driver
did for Intel AMT Release 1.0.

Messages from the Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) Linux driver will be sent
to the system's log (i.e. /var/log/messages).

Building and installing the Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) Linux driver:
-----------------------------
In order to build and install the Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) Linux driver,
call "make install".
Call "make uninstall" to uninstall and remove theIntel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) driver.
In order to load and use the driver call "modprobe dcmi" or "insmod dcmi.ko".

The Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) driver may also be built and
installed manually, by first calling "make", then "insmod dcmi.ko".
Remove by calling "rmmod dcmi.ko".

Accessing The FW Via Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) driver:
-----------------------------
Once the Intel(R) Data Center Host Interface (IDC-HI) driver is running, an
application can open a file to it connecting to an application on the firmware
side, and send and receive DCMI messages to that application.
